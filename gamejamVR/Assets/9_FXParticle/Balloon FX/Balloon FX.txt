---Balloon FX---------------------------
----------------------------------------

To use the effects, import the asset to your project.
The effect prefabs can simply be dragged and dropped into the scene and they will play automatically.
----------------------------------------

Two types of balloon effects are included in this pack. A "Looping" type which will loop forever or until disabled by a script.

Second type is a "Release" type which will release one set of balloons.

The balloons will (more or less) realistically bump into things on their path upwards.
They will also point towards the direction they are moving.
